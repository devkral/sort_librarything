Installation:
Open a "new bookmark"-dialog (if the bookmark has no address line: save the bookmark and edit it).
Insert the content of list_names_ready.txt in the address line and name the bookmark like you want.

"Compiling":
Remove the newlines in list_names_template.txt until you have one line left.

list_names_template.txt is just for a better overview over the code.

Hacking:
Every statement has to end with ; except functions and if clauses when they end with }.

Thanks:
Thanks to @work for his brilliant example.
